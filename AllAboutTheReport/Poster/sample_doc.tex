    \begin{block}{Introduction}
    
        The problem of optimal order execution, market impact prediction and other issues related to the structure of the order book are very important for the industry, 
        so in recent decades a new young and interesting science has been built around these issues. In our research, we are looking for a way 
        to connect the latest advances in this science associated with various variations of the Obizhaeva--Wang model with the needs of industry.

    \begin{block}{Why the OW model?}
        The supply/demand of Ô¨Ånancial securities is in general not perfectly elastic. This fact is true even for liquid European markets, if we talk about 
        much less liquid Russian markets, neglecting this fact can be disastrous. The main difference between Obizhaeva's model and others is precisely 
        that resiliency --- the speed at which supply/demand recovers to its steady state after a trade --- plays a key role in it.

    \begin{alertblock}{Objectives}
    
    Here are the main parts of a broccoli plant:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Floret: The florets are the small, tightly packed clusters that make up the head of broccoli. These are the edible portions of the plant and are composed of immature flower buds.

    	\item Stalk: The stalk of broccoli is the main central stem that supports the florets. It is typically thick and sturdy, providing structural support for the head.

    	\item Leaves: Broccoli plants have large, dark green leaves that extend from the stalk. While the leaves are not commonly consumed, they are edible and can be cooked or used in recipes, similar to other leafy greens.

    \end{itemize}
    
    \end{alertblock}
    
    %------------------------------------------------
    \begin{block}{Problem statement}
    These components together form the fractional structure of broccoli, with the florets being the most recognizable and commonly consumed part.

    \begin{alertblock}{Broccoli is rough!}
    
     When we examine the structure of broccoli, we can observe repeated patterns that resemble the whole plant. The branching pattern of the main stem is reflected in the smaller branches, and these branches further divide into even smaller branches, creating a self-similar pattern.

    \begin{block}{Mathematical Section}
    
    This self-similar pattern is characteristic of fractals. Fractals exhibit a property known as self-similarity, where parts of the object resemble the whole, or sections of the object resemble each other. 
    
    $$
    N = \varepsilon^{-D}
    $$
    
    The fractal nature of broccoli's structure is visually intriguing and has been studied by scientists and mathematicians interested in the beauty and mathematical properties of natural forms. 
    
    The branching pattern of a broccoli plant follows a fractal geometry known as a self-similar fractal. A self-similar fractal is one in which smaller parts resemble the overall shape or structure of the whole.

        \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        This recursive branching and self-similar pattern in the structure of broccoli are what make it an example of a fractal in nature. Fractals can be found in various natural phenomena, and broccoli serves as a visually appealing example of fractal geometry in plants.
    
        In conclusion, broccoli exhibits fractal characteristics in its structure. 
        The self-repeating patterns and recursive branching observed in broccoli's stalks and florets resemble the mathematical concept of fractals. 
        This self-similarity at different scales is a defining characteristic of fractals. Therefore, broccoli can be considered an example of a fractal in nature.
