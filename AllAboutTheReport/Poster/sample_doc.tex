    \begin{block}{Introduction}
    
        Issues related to the structure of the order book are very important for the industry, 
        so in recent decades a new young and interesting science has been built around these issues. In our research, we are looking for a way 
        to connect the latest advances in this science associated with various variations of the Obizhaeva--Wang model with the needs of industry.
    
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Optimal execution problem}
    
        The idea of that problem is quite simple. If one wants to sell or buy an amount of an asset large enough to have a significant 
        impact on the market, he, obviously should not do it by one order: it would be very expensive, since a large order 
        would remove all the upper levels in the limit order book. Therefore, in practice, all large orders are split into a large number of small ones. 
        For example, one can simply divide an order into N equal parts and sell them at regular intervals (this is called TWAP). 
        To find a better solution, we consider the OW model, in which terms the problem has the following form: \par  


    % \begin{block}{Why the OW model?}
    %     The supply/demand of ﬁnancial securities is in general not perfectly elastic. This fact is true even for liquid European markets, if we talk about 
    %     much less liquid Russian markets, neglecting this fact can be disastrous. The main difference between Obizhaeva's model and others is precisely 
    %     that resiliency --- the speed at which supply/demand recovers to its steady state after a trade --- plays a key role in it.
    % \end{block}

        
        \begin{align}
            J_0 = \min _{\{x_0 \cdots x_N \}} E_0 \left[ \sum _{n=0}^N [A_{t_n} + x_n /(2q)] x_n\right],  \\
            A_{t_n} = F_{t_n} + \lambda (X_0 - X_{t_n}) + s/2 + \sum _{i=0}^{n-1} x_i \kappa e^{- \rho \tau (n - i)}
        \end{align}
        
       Here:
       \begin{itemize}
        \item The trader has to buy $\mathbf{X_0}$ units of a security over a ﬁxed time period $[0,T]$. $x_{t_n}$ 
        --- the trade size at $t_n = \tau n$, where $\tau = T / N$. $X_{t_n} := X_0 - \sum _{t_k < t_n} x_{t_k}$. 
        \item $B_{t_n}$ and $A_{t_n}$ --- bid and ask prices at $t_n$. $V_{t_n} = \frac{A_{t_n} + B_{t_n}}{2}$ 
        --- the mid-quote price; $s$ --- the bid–ask spread.
        \item $F_t$ --- the fundamental value of the security.
        % \item $q(P)$ --- the density of limit orders to sell at price $P$.
        \item Parameter $\lambda$ captures the permanent price impact.
        \item Parameter $q$ depends on LOB density. 
        \item $\kappa = \frac{1}{q} - \lambda $
        \item Parameter $\rho$ captures the resiliency.

       \end{itemize}

    Proposition 2 from \ref{obizhaeva2013optimal} gives an optimal strategy for big $N$.
    
    \begin{proposition}
        As $N \rightarrow \infty$, the optimal execution strategy becomes:
        \begin{align}
            \lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} x_0 = \frac{X_0}{\rho T + 2}, \\
            \lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} x_n / (T/N) = \frac{\rho X_0}{\rho T + 2}, \\
        \end{align}

        \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        This recursive branching and self-similar pattern in the structure of broccoli are what make it an example of a fractal in nature. Fractals can be found in various natural phenomena, and broccoli serves as a visually appealing example of fractal geometry in plants.
    
        In conclusion, broccoli exhibits fractal characteristics in its structure. 
        The self-repeating patterns and recursive branching observed in broccoli's stalks and florets resemble the mathematical concept of fractals. 
        This self-similarity at different scales is a defining characteristic of fractals. Therefore, broccoli can be considered an example of a fractal in nature.
