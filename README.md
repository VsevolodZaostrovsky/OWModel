# OW model

## Current research: OW model
**Supervisors**: Anton Belyakov, Alexey Savin

**Objectives**:
1. Propose methodology for fitting OWM factors and use it to get optimal execution strategy.
2. Propose a backtest procedure for the optimal execution algorithm, implement it and compare the algorithm with TWAP.
